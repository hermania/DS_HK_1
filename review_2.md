## Objective/Abstract: 
This article discusses the growing impact of big data in the legal profession and the potential use of data science in legal bargaining in the shadow of trial where lawyers have traditionally relied on their knowledge of precedent, intuition, and previous interactions with the presiding judge and opposing counsel to forecast trial outcomes and litigation costs. The article suggests that technology for leveraging legal data is moving the practice of law into the shadow of the trends and patterns observable in aggregated litigation data.

## Style: 
This paper is aimed at an audience familiar with the legal profession, in particular the American legal system. The premise is that a data driven approach could aid in answering questions typically posed to lawyers by clients, such as how long will a trial take and what will it cost.

## Methods: What methodologies did the paper use to approach its objective? How well did they work?
The authors do not rely on specific analysis of data, i.e. they do not actually analyze a set of data as much as they discuss the overall application of data science to law. 

The authors look at current available American legal databases, notably the Public Access to Court Electronic Records or PACER, discuss PACERâ€™s advantages and drawbacks, and the advantages of a data science approach to eliminate much of the (unreliable) guesswork that was done in the past (e.g. to predict litigation outcomes).

The authors also discuss the potential drawbacks of a data driven approach notably how such schemes can result in self fulfilling (or in other cases, self-defeating or self-nullifying) prophecies, the impact of unforeseen black swan events and noise-signal issues.

## Conclusions: 

The authors do a good job of examining the pros and cons of a data driven approach to helping lawyers predict litigation outcomes though they do not, perhaps adequately acknowledge that as all legal cases are unique, different cases can be distinguished from each other to some degree. 
In addition, the methodology relies to some extent on the persuasiveness of judicial precedent in predicting legal outcomes, an approach that is more applicable to American and common law jurisdictions where judicial precedent applies (under the legal doctrine of stare decisis) than civil law jurisdictions where judicial precedent is relevant. 
Nevertheless, the paper demonstrates how the use of data science can be applied to the legal profession to improve services to clients and is worthwhile for this alone.
